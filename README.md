# [We Like The Rocks](https://twitter.com/weliketherocks) Discord Bot

To use this code for your own bot clone or fork repo add `.env` inside `.env` add `TOKEN`, which is the discord bot token value, for your own discord bot asigned to your account via:

https://discord.com/developers/applications

Then add [Infura](https://infura.io) project ID to `.env` as `PROJECT_ID` with coresponding value for mainnet.

Finally add [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis) API key as `ETHERSCAN` to `.env`

This is all that should be needed to add in order to get application running for your discord server.
